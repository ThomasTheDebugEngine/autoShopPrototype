# brief
a very early prototype for an auto shop website, only providing location on a dynamic map, due to the logistical requirements of having to set up an e-commerce website, might expand in the future.

the original plan of the website was to be a fully fledged e commerce platform, however the local shop that this website was meant for could not find the required copy-right free material in order to feature on the website, so the website instead got reduced to only a dynamic map and simple components due to this change in requirements.
